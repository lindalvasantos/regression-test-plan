WHERE: Stage4 environment
HOW: End-to-End automated/manual Test Cases and Exploratory Testing



## Assumptions, Dependencies & Constraints

- The Test Strategy is a living document and will be continually updated through the project life cycle;
- Each Development area, System Analysts, Product Owners and Testers will work as a team to add test cases where appropriate to ensure the stories added to regression are completely tested;
- Regression Team will identify Acceptance Criteria for regression within ALM;
- Regression Team will manually execute regression covering in complement of Test Automation (Testing Automation will be incorporated as appropriate for regression efforts);
- Regression Team will  enhance the regression suite with appropriate Acceptance Criteria from each prior release as part of the BAU process;
- Regression Team will execute regression in Stage4 environment at intervals based upon the delivery schedule (All release dates can be found on Upcoming Commercial Release Dates Calendar);
- Development’s role is to assist in defect resolution and make modifications when the expected results are not achieved;
- Defect tracking will be thru ALM;
