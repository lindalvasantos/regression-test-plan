- Each Development area, System Analysts, Product Owners and Testers will work as a team to add test cases where appropriate to ensure the stories added to regression are completely tested;
- Regression Team will identify Acceptance Criteria for regression within ALM;
- Regression Team will manually execute regression covering in complement of Test Automation (Testing Automation will be incorporated as appropriate for regression efforts);
- Regression Team will  enhance the regression suite with appropriate Acceptance Criteria from each prior release as part of the BAU process;
- Regression Team will execute regression in Stage4 environment at intervals based upon the delivery schedule (All release dates can be found on Upcoming Commercial Release Dates Calendar);
